Introducing my new pixel art platformer! In this game, you jump through challenging puzzles, move boxes to reach new areas, and collect fruits to unlock levers. With charming retro graphics and simple yet engaging mechanics, it's a fun and adventurous!   

This project fufils the theme of connection by the form of puzzle solving and collecting the correct type of fruit to open the lever of that fruit to continue to the next sections of the level.
